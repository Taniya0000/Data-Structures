/*
Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not.
A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. 
An empty linked list is considered as circular.
Note: The linked list does not contains any inner loop.
Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
Output: 1
